### **Features of a Stack**
- **LIFO Principle:** Stacks operate on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis, meaning the last element added is the first to be removed.
- **Push and Pop Operations:** 
  - **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - **Pop:** Removes the top element of the stack.
- **Top Operation:** Allows viewing the element at the top without removing it.
- **Dynamic or Static Implementation:**
  - Can be implemented using arrays (static) or linked lists (dynamic).
- **Memory Usage:** Utilizes less memory when implemented as an array but becomes dynamic with linked lists.

### **Types and Categories of Stacks**
1. **Simple Stack:**
   - A standard stack that follows the LIFO principle.

2. **Bounded Stack:**
   - Has a fixed capacity and cannot grow dynamically (e.g., when implemented as arrays).

3. **Dynamic Stack:**
   - Grows and shrinks dynamically based on the number of elements (e.g., when implemented as a linked list).

4. **Double-ended Stack (Deque):**
   - Allows insertions and deletions from both ends.

### **Real-life Applications**
- **Expression Evaluation:**
  - Example: Evaluating postfix expressions using operators and operands.
- **Expression Conversion:**
  - Example: Converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix.
- **Undo Mechanism in Software:**
  - Example: Maintaining a history of actions in a text editor.
- **Call Stack in Recursion:**
  - Example: Function calls in programming languages like Python or C++.
- **Browser Backtracking:**
  - Example: Navigating back through previously visited web pages.
- **Tree and Graph Traversals:**
  - Example: Depth First Search (DFS) implementations.

### **Advantages of Stacks**
- **Simple and Intuitive:** Easy to implement and use.
- **Memory Management:** Used to manage memory efficiently in recursion and function calls.
- **Efficient Access:** Provides constant-time access to the top element.
- **Control of Data Flow:** Ideal for operations requiring controlled, sequential data processing.

---

### **Disadvantages of Stacks**
- **Limited Access:** Only the top element can be accessed directly.
- **Fixed Size (in Arrays):** If implemented as an array, stack size needs to be predefined.
- **Overflow and Underflow:** Susceptible to stack overflow (when exceeding capacity) and underflow (when trying to pop from an empty stack).
